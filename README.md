bibliotheca-lookup
==================

A tool to convert biblical references to [Bibliotheca](http://bibliotheca.co/) page numbers.

Part of Bibliotheca’s beauty is in its lack of inline numerical references, but the liturgical world is still laden with books, chapters, and verses.

So with this tool, when preacher man throws down the verse of the day and all you’ve got in your pocket is your hardbound Bibliotheca boxed set with solid walnut slipcase, you’ll be prepared.

Hark!
-----

For now this is a proof of concept. The code is messy and all the page numbers are _wrong_. But you can help me build the complete lookup table which will power this tool at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_Ee4x1X0o0nqes2hm9aPgRAta_jOsb6CEG6TnorDn4/edit#gid=0.

Getting the softcover edition? Please get in touch with me! If the pagination is different, I want to make a version of this tool for you too!

Sincerely always,
