Convert biblical references to Bibliotheca page numbers

When Adam Greene’s [Bibliotheca](http://www.bibliotheca.co/) launches, we will have in our hands a beatiful literary bible stripped of numerical references.

This tool aims to convert biblical book/chapter/verse references to Bibiotheca page numbers, for easier text lookup.

It is beta and scrappy (and, for now, inaccurate), but it’ll get there.
